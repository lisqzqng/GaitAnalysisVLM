# GaitAnalysisVLM
Enhancing Gait Video Analysis in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Knowledge Augmentation in Vision Language Model
## Numerical Text Embedding Space
**We visualize the numerical text embeddings projected by MLPs learned through cross-modal training.** We leverage _Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection _ to reduce the embedding dimension from 64 to 3. The projections of per-class text features are circled in yellow.
