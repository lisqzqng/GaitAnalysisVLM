C1	Normal gait has the following features. Stability: healthy individuals usually have stable gait patterns with consistent stride lengths and minimal sway. Stride Length: healthy individuals tend to have longer stride lengths than in DLB and AD. Cadence: healthy people maintain a regular and consistent cadence. Speed: walking speed is generally faster and more consistent than in DLB and AD. Symmetry: gait is symmetrical with even distribution of weight and movement. Rhythm: rhythm of walking is consistent, with predictable heel-to-toe sequences. Arm Swing: there is natural arm swing in synchronisation with leg movements.
C2	Gait in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) has the following features. Slowness: markedly slower walking speed compared to healthy individuals, and more marked slowness than in AD. Postural Instability: difficulty in maintaining upright posture. Rigidity: stiffness in movement, which can affect the fluidity of the gait. Freezing of gait: the feet feel as if they are stuck to the floor. Shuffling: tendency to shuffle feet, with reduced lift-off, which increases the risk of tripping and resembles Parkinsonian gait. Reduced arm swing: can be more pronounced than in AD. Balance problems: more pronounced balance problems than in AD and falls are more frequent than in AD.
C3	Gait in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has the following features. Slowness: similar to DLB, individuals with AD may walk more slowly than healthy individuals. Dual-task Difficulty: greater difficulty walking while performing another task than in DLB, leading to more pronounced gait disturbances when talking. Cadence: The cadence may become irregular, contributing to an overall unsteady gait. Postural Instability: individuals with AD may have difficulties with balance and posture but itâ€™s less pronounced than in DLB. AD primarily shows a decline in spatial navigation and executive function, affecting gait indirectly through cognitive decline rather than direct motor impairment.
